## Sociapp - Simple social media (twitter) clone with Spring and React

This is a sample web application that I created by watching the following course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-ve-react-ile-web-uygulamas-gelistirmek/

## Tools

Backend - Spring Framework, Junit, RestAssured
Frontend - Reactjs

The course didn't included testing part, so i created tests on my own.
